The goal of this assignment was to create an AI paddle for Pong. With the entire game already given for the purpose of this course, all
that needed to be added was for the Paddle class to take an extra argument, that argument defining whether or not each side's paddle was
player or computer controlled. If they're defined as an AI, instead of taking keyboard inputs, the paddle moves up or down depending on if
the y position of the ball is greater or lesser than its own.
