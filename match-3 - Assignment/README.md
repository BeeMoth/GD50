The features implimented into this simplified version of Match 3 are the incease of time for each match, scaling the variety of tiles
based off what level the user is on, making it so swapping blocks can only be done if it'd result in a match, and creating a shiny tile
that removes the entire row it's in if one (or more) are included in a match.

Overall, everything worked pretty logically, I just kept getting caught up on myself either trying to blitz through the thought process
for no reason, or not fully understanding parts of the code. That was defintiely a bit of a slap to the face when I realized that the
reason I couldn't forward the user's level into the board functions was because I was doing it in the wrong file. Whew. That was
unfortunate.
