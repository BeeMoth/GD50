[So this is a bit of a mess due to me focusing more on drawing in the past week or so, hence the lack of comments, general sloppy code
and delay. It's really not pretty, but it works, and I'd rather keep on moving than not. But that's beyond the point. Kinda.]

This assignment we took a premade Mario clone and added a key spawn that the player can pickup, which once done, they can then hit a
special locked block that spawns a flag at the end of the procedurally generated level. Touching this flag spawns the player on a new
level.
